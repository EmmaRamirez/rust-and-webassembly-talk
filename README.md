# Rust + Webassembly



## Links

The [Awesome Wasm list](https://github.com/mbasso/awesome-wasm) has a great deal of links and videos and other resources you'll find useful, but below are some of my favorites (with reasoning!):

[Cartoon Intro to Webassembly](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-cartoon-intro-to-webassembly/) Lin Clark's great overview of webassembly&mdash;filled with helpful illustrations if you're a visual learner.

[Webassembly Studio](https://webassembly.studio/) An interactive way to mess around with wasm without all the complicated compilation stuff!
