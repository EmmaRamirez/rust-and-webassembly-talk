# Abstract
## Assembling the Web with Rust
### Tapping Into Asm Performance

Want to create powerful, high-performance web apps? Then this talk is for you! Instead of a regular performance talk, 
we focus here on abstracting key parts of your web app into Webassembly. By compiling Rust, a memory and thread safe language, 
into Webassembly code, we can swap out bits of Javascript for a faster codebase. We'll explore use cases and examples, 
with a focus on real-world problems that we can theoretically solve with wasm and Rust. While talk is aimed at an 
intermediate level, no experience with Rust is required!
